lockssscripts
=============

This is a collection of miscellaneous scripts that interact with the LOCKSS SOAP API.

Before using them you will need to do some configuration in your LOCKSS boxes, specifically, whitelist the IP address of the machine running the scripts and create a LOCKSS user account that has permission to access the API. Additional details are included in file-level comments in each script.

If you want to add additional scripts to this repo, ping me.
